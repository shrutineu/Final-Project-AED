# SafeNet: A Rapid Response System
---

## 📖 Project Overview
SafeNet is an **Rapid emergency response system** that leverages **drones, real-time communication, and automated coordination** to **optimize emergency response times** and improve life-saving efforts.

When a **911 call** is made:
- The system **identifies the victim's location** and routes the call to the nearest emergency department.
- A **drone is deployed** to provide **live monitoring** and **real-time medical guidance** from an **on-call doctor**.
- If it's an accident, the drone **scans the vehicle’s license plate**, alerts the **police**, and **notifies emergency contacts**.
- The system **calculates the shortest ambulance route** and coordinates with hospitals to dispatch assistance.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
**Current emergency response times range between 15-30 minutes** – which can be fatal in **critical medical conditions** like cardiac arrest, where immediate intervention within **5-10 minutes** is essential.

💡 **Our solution**: Deploy **Ambulance Drones** with **life-saving medical kits** and **real-time remote guidance**, significantly reducing response times and improving survival rates.

## ✅ Proposed Solution
### **🚁 Ambulance Drone**
- **Automatically deployed** via a **911 call trigger**.
- Carries **essential medical equipment**:
  - **Automated External Defibrillator (AED)**
  - **CPR aids**
  - **Oxygen masks**
  - **Emergency medications**
  - **First aid supplies**

### **📡 Efficient Coordination**
- **Automated routing** to the **nearest hospital**.
- **Real-time alerts** sent to **on-call doctors**.
- **Optimized ambulance dispatching** to reduce delays.

### **👮 Police Collaboration**
- **Drone scans vehicle license plates** at accident sites.
- **Police fetch victim details** and **alert emergency contacts**.

## 🏗 Workflow - How SafeNet Works
### **📌 Emergency Call Handling**
1. Victim **dials 911**.
2. **Admin fetches location** and routes the call to the nearest emergency department.

### **🚁 Drone Deployment & Doctor Assistance**
3. **Drone is dispatched** to the emergency site.
4. **Live footage streamed** to an **on-call doctor**.
5. Doctor provides **real-time guidance** (e.g., **CPR instructions**).

### **🔍 License Plate Scanning (Accidents)**
6. **Drone scans the vehicle’s license plate**.
7. **Police retrieve owner details** and notify emergency contacts.

### **🚑 Shortest Path Computation & Ambulance Dispatch**
8. **Drone calculates the fastest ambulance route** and shares it with the hospital.
9. **Hospital admin assigns an ambulance** and dispatches it to the site.

### **🏠 Drone Recovery**
10. After the ambulance arrives, the **drone returns to its station**.
